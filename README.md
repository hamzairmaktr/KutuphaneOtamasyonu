# IKitaplik - Library Management System

[ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· TÃ¼rkÃ§e](README_TR.md) \| [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English](README.md)

## Overview

**IKitaplik** is a modular, full-stack Library Management System built with modern .NET technologies. It provides a robust backend REST API, a clean and interactive Blazor UI frontend, and a layered architecture for maintainability and scalability. The system supports book, student, writer, category, deposit (borrowing), donation, and user management, with authentication and authorization.

## Architecture

The solution is organized into several projects, each with a clear responsibility:

- **Core**: Shared base entities, interfaces, and utility classes.
- **IKitaplik.Entities**: Entity and DTO definitions for the domain model.
- **IKitaplik.DataAccess**: Data access layer using Entity Framework Core, repository, and unit of work patterns.
- **IKitaplik.Business**: Business logic, service interfaces, and implementations, including validation.
- **IKitaplik.Api**: ASP.NET Core Web API exposing RESTful endpoints.
- **IKitaplik.BlazorUI**: Blazor Server UI for end-users, with authentication and CRUD operations.

---

## Technologies

- **.NET 7+ / .NET 8+**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **Blazor Server**
- **AutoMapper**
- **FluentValidation**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **MudBlazor** (UI components)
- **Blazored.LocalStorage** (for token storage)
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** (API documentation)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 7+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or compatible database

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzairmaktr/KutuphaneOtamasyonu
   cd KutuphaneOtamasyonu
   ```

2. **Configure the database:**
   - Update the connection string in `IKitaplik.Api/appsettings.json` and `IKitaplik.BlazorUI/appsettings.json`.

3. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project IKitaplik.DataAccess
   ```

4. **Run the API:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project IKitaplik.Api
   ```

5. **Run the Blazor UI:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project IKitaplik.BlazorUI
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   - API: `https://localhost:<port>/swagger`
   - UI: `https://localhost:<port>/`

## API Endpoints

The API exposes endpoints for all major entities. Example endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/book/getall` - List all books
- `POST /api/book/add` - Add a new book
- `POST /api/book/update` - Update a book
- `POST /api/book/delete` - Delete a book
- `GET /api/student/getall` - List all students
- ...and more for categories, writers, deposits, donations, and movements.

All endpoints are protected by JWT authentication and role-based authorization.

---

## UI Overview

- **Login/Register:** Secure authentication for users.
- **Navigation:** Sidebar with links to Home, Book List, Add Book, etc.
- **Book List:** Paginated, searchable, and sortable table of books.
- **Book Add:** Form to add new books.
- **Student Management:** List, add, update, and delete students.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with MudBlazor for a modern look and feel.

## Entities

### Core Entities

- **Book:** Barcode, Name, Category, Writer, Shelf, Piece, Situation, PageSize, etc.
- **Student:** StudentNumber, Name, Class, Telephone, Email, NumberOfBooksRead, Point, etc.
- **Writer:** Name, BirthDate, DeathDate, Biography.
